		<h2 class="text">Trends in Commuting: Shifts in Transportation Modes from 2019 to 2022</h2> 
    <h3 id="publicdesc">Public Transportation</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <img src="images/public-transportation.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Public Transportation" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <p>Public transportation, including buses, trains, and subways, was a common method of travel before the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in urban areas. However, the dataset shows a noticeable decline in its usage over the years, particularly in 2020, which could be attributed to health concerns and lockdowns caused by the pandemic. This category highlights the impact of external factors on transportation habits, especially in large cities where public transport is a primary mode of commuting.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3 id="alonedesc">Drove Alone (Car)</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
            <img src="images/drove-alone.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Drove Alone" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
            <p>Driving alone represents the most common form of commuting in many countries. The dataset reflects a steady preference for this mode over the years, likely due to its convenience, comfort, and flexibility. While it remains a dominant transportation method, this trend raises concerns about traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and the inefficiency of underutilized vehicles on the road.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3 id="otherdesc">Taxi, Motorcycle, or Other</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <img src="images/taxi-motorcycle.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Taxi, Motorcycle, or Other" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <p>This category represents the use of taxis, motorcycles, and other personal or shared vehicle services like ridesharing apps (Uber, Lyft). It shows fluctuations over time, reflecting changing economic and social conditions. The sharp drop in 2020, when many people stayed home, is evident. As restrictions lifted, this mode of transport rebounded, especially in urban areas where taxis and ridesharing remain popular alternatives to public transportation.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3 id="homedesc">Worked at Home</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <img src="images/worked-at-home.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Worked at Home" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <p>The pandemic introduced a significant shift toward remote work, and this category shows a sharp increase in 2020. The dataset indicates that more individuals started working from home, effectively eliminating the need for daily commuting. This trend may continue in the future, even after the pandemic, as many organizations have adopted flexible working models. The rise in this category suggests that the workplace and commuting habits are undergoing long-term transformations.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3 id="walkdesc">Walked</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <img src="images/walked.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Walked" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <p>Walking, often used for short distances, remains a steady and environmentally friendly mode of transport. The data reveals that walking usage did not see drastic changes over the years, despite the shifts in other categories. This indicates that walking continues to be a viable option for short, local trips, especially in urban environments. It may also be associated with the increase in work-from-home options, as people might prefer walking when they no longer need to commute long distances.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3 id="carpooldesc">Carpool</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <img src="images/carpool.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Carpool" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <p>Carpooling is an efficient transportation option that reduces the number of vehicles on the road and lowers emissions. This category remains relatively stable over the years, although it saw a slight drop in 2020 due to the pandemic's social distancing requirements. Carpooling might see a resurgence post-pandemic as people return to the office and look for cost-effective and eco-friendly alternatives to driving alone.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3 id="bikedesc">Bicycle</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <img src="images/bicycle.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Bicycle" />
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <p>Cycling is an eco-friendly, healthy, and cost-effective way to travel. The dataset shows minor fluctuations in bicycle use, with a slight increase in 2021 and 2022. This could be due to growing concerns about the environment and the rising popularity of cycling as a mode of exercise and transportation. In cities with dedicated bike lanes and cycling infrastructure, biking is an increasingly popular option for short-distance commuting.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
<div id="why-this-dataset">
    <h3>Why This Dataset Is Interesting</h3>
    <p>This dataset is interesting because it reflects a diverse range of transportation habits over a four-year period, offering a glimpse into how global events like the COVID-19 pandemic affected how people commute. It highlights shifts in behavior, such as the increased reliance on remote work (working at home) and changes in how people view public transportation. The dataset provides valuable insights into transportation trends, which can help policymakers, businesses, and urban planners make informed decisions about infrastructure, traffic management, and environmental sustainability.</p>
</div>


<div id="why-we-chose-this-visualization">
    <h3>Why We Chose This Visualization</h3>
    <p>We chose a bar graph to visualize this dataset because it effectively shows year-over-year comparisons across multiple categories of transportation. The bar graph allows for an easy visual comparison between the different transportation modes, highlighting trends and shifts over time. Each mode of transport is represented with a distinct bar for each year, which makes it clear how the proportions of transportation choices changed. The simplicity of the bar graph ensures that the data is accessible and easily understood, making it a perfect choice for presenting this dataset's information.</p>
